## Key Features and Components

- **WebAssembly Computing**: Harness the power of WebAssembly for efficient and scalable computation within decentralized applications.
- **IPFS Integration**: Utilize IPFS for secure and decentralized storage and retrieval of data, ensuring data integrity and availability.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Embrace a serverless paradigm for flexible and cost-effective deployment of dApps, without the complexities of managing traditional servers.
- **Technical Support**: Benefit from seamless integration with Filecoin-Lassie for IPFS file retrieval, Filecoin-IPLD-Go-Car for IPFS Car file extraction, Extism for wasm plug-in mechanism, wazero for wasm virtual machine, and Fiber for high-performance HTTP server capabilities.

## How it's Made

Here's a breakdown of how WASM-IPFS-Serverless was built, including the technologies used, their integration, and any notable aspects:

### WebAssembly (WASM) Computing

- **Technology**: Leveraged WebAssembly for its efficient and portable bytecode format, enabling high-performance computing within the serverless environment.
- **Integration**: Integrated WebAssembly runtime libraries and tools to compile and execute WASM modules seamlessly within the serverless framework.

### IPFS Integration

- **Technology**: Utilized IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized storage and retrieval of data.
- **Integration**: Integrated IPFS libraries and APIs to interact with the IPFS network, allowing for secure and decentralized data storage and retrieval.

### Partner Technologies and Benefits

- **Filecoin-Lassie**: Leveraged for IPFS file retrieval, enhancing data access capabilities within the serverless environment.
- **Filecoin-IPLD-Go-Car**: Used for IPFS Car file extraction, enabling efficient handling of IPFS Car files within the project.
- **Extism**: Integrated for wasm plug-in mechanism, facilitating extensibility and customization of the serverless environment through wasm plugins.
- **wazero**: Utilized for wasm virtual machine capabilities, ensuring efficient execution of WebAssembly code within the serverless framework.
- **Fiber**: Integrated for high-performance HTTP server functionalities, enhancing network communication and HTTP request handling within the serverless environment.

### Notable Aspects

- **Dynamic IPFS Integration**: Dynamically integrated with IPFS using Filecoin-Lassie and IPFS CID references in the configuration, allowing for seamless interaction with IPFS resources.

Overall, WASM-IPFS-Serverless aims to improve the convenience of decentralized and edge trusted computing, and aims to provide a powerful and efficient runtime framework for decentralized applications.
